// To do list:
//
// - Make the keychain member protected and switch it to be a hashmap of some kind so key lookup ops are faster.
// - Refactor how keys are managed to better handle things like deterministic wallets in future.
// - Decompose the class where possible: break logic out into classes that can be customized/replaced by the user.
//     - [Auto]saving to a backing store
//     - Key management
//     - just generally make Wallet smaller and easier to work with
// - Make clearing of transactions able to only rewind the wallet a certain distance instead of all blocks.

/**
 * <p>A Wallet stores keys and a record of transactions that send and receive value from those keys. Using these,
 * it is able to create new transactions that spend the recorded transactions, and this is the fundamental operation
 * of the digitalcoin protocol.</p>
 *
 * <p>To learn more about this class, read <b><a href="http://code.google.com/p/digitalcoinj/wiki/WorkingWithTheWallet">
 *     working with the wallet.</a></b></p>
 *
 * <p>To fill up a Wallet with transactions, you need to use it in combination with a {@link BlockChain} and various
 * other objects, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/digitalcoinj/wiki/GettingStarted">Getting started</a> tutorial
 * on the website to learn more about how to set everything up.</p>
 *
 * <p>Wallets can be serialized using either Java serialization - this is not compatible across versions of digitalcoinj,
 * or protocol buffer serialization. You need to save the wallet whenever it changes, there is an auto-save feature
 * that simplifies this for you although you're still responsible for manually triggering a save when your app is about
 * to quit because the auto-save feature waits a moment before actually committing to disk to avoid IO thrashing when
 * the wallet is changing very fast (eg due to a block chain sync). See
 * {@link Wallet#autosaveToFile(java.io.File, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, com.google.digitalcoin.core.Wallet.AutosaveEventListener)}
 * for more information about this.</p>

    // purposes of the explanation below.

    // 1. Outbound tx is created by us: ->pending

    //     ->unspent/spent

    //     best chain, we don't mark it as such here. It'll eventually show up after a re-org.

    // 1. Tx is present in old chain and not present in new chain

    //       as miners resurrect them and re-include into the new best chain.
    // 2. Tx is not present in old chain and is present in new chain
    //       <-inactive  and  ->unspent/spent
    // 3. Tx is present in new chain and shares inputs with a pending transaction, including those that were resurrected
