		<p>Some words about safety of your Digitalcoins:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Digitalcoins in Digitalcoin Wallet are stored on the device.
				<b>If you lose your device, you'll lose your Digitalcoins.</b>
				Just like money in your physical wallet.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Before uninstalling Digitalcoin Wallet</b> (or clearing app data/wiping your device), <b>transfer your Digitalcoins to another wallet</b>.
				Any remaining Digitalcoins will be lost.
			</li> 
			<li>
				<b>Transactions cannot be undone</b>.
				If you send your Digitalcoins into the void, there is no way to get them back unless you know the receiver and he/she is willing to send them back.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Keep your mobile device safe!</b>
				Do only install apps you fully trust.
				Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
			</li>
			<li>
				Keep the risk low! <b>Only use Digitalcoin Wallet with small amounts</b> for day use,
				and keep your Digitalcoin savings at a safer place.
			</li>
		</ul>
